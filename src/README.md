# Measuring Sustainability in Open-Source Software: The Impact of Code Complexity

## Setup
Extract the data for analysis and models training:
```
tar -xzvf data.tar.gz
```

The data for our experiment is consist of two files, complexity_data.csv and filter_repos_with_language.csv, which includes the metadata and code complexity of open-source software (OSS) projects.
